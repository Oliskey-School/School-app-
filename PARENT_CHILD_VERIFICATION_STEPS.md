# Validating the Parent-Child Link

It appears you are currently managing two different accounts. To confirm the link is working, you must distinguish between the **Student Account** and the **Parent Account**.

## 1. Identify Your Current Session
Check the **Profile Picture & Name** in the top right corner of the dashboard.

| If you see... | You are logged in as... | What you see |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **olamide oluwapelumi** | **Student** | You will see your own grades, homework, and a "Guardians" section in your profile. |
| **Mr kayode odupitan** | **Parent** | You will see a "My Children" list containing Olamide, fee status, and attendance. |

## 2. How to Verify the Link (Correctly)

### Step A: Verify Student View
1.  Log in as **`olamide.oluwapelumi@student.school.com`**.
2.  Go to **Profile** (or More > Edit Profile).
3.  Look for the **"Guardians"** section.
4.  **Success**: You should see "Mr kayode odupitan" listed there.

### Step B: Verify Parent View (The Goal)
1.  **LOG OUT** of the student account.
2.  Log in as **`oliskeylee@gmail.com`**.
3.  You should land on the **Parent Dashboard**.
4.  **Success**: You should see a card for **"olamide oluwapelumi"** with attendance and fee info.
    *   *If you see "No Children Linked", please let me know, as that would indicate a database sync issue despite the link existing in Admin.*

## Common Issues
*   **"I see the student details"**: If you see the full student dashboard with "Learning Resources", you are logged in as the student.
*   **"I see the link in Admin"**: The Admin dashboard confirmation (your first screenshot) proves the database connection is correct. The only remaining step is logging in as the parent to view it.
